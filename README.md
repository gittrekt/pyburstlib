## Description
pysignumlib is updated to be used with signum instead of burst. This branch is meant to be a git submodule into another git project. The main branch should be able to be installed with pip and work as a python module. 

pyburstlib is a python library built to allow for interactions with the Burst Wallet API programmatically via a python wrapper as well as a library providing access to Burst functions in native python.  

## Getting Started this branch

1. git submodule add pysignumlib < giturl >
2. git submodule init
3. Add a pyburstlib.ini file
4. from pysignumlib.client import *
5. Explore the available api's and build from there
